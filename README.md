## Game Logic
### Main Components:
- **`nextSequence()`**: Generates a new color in the sequence, updates the game level, and plays the corresponding sound.
- **`checkAnswer(currentLevel)`**: Validates the user's input against the game sequence.
- **`playSound(colorName)`**: Plays the sound associated with the given color.
- **`animatePress(currentColor)`**: Adds a pressed effect to the clicked button.
- **`startOver()`**: Resets the game state after a wrong answer.

### Event Handlers:
- `keydown`: Starts the game when a key is pressed.
- `click`: Handles user input and triggers game logic.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a high-score tracker to display the best performance.
- Implement different difficulty modes (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Add a timer to make the game more challenging.
- Enhance the UI/UX with animations and responsive design.
